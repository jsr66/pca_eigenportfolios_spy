# Computing Eigenportfolios of S&P500 Stocks Using Principal Component Analysis

In this project, I compute eigenportfolios for the stocks in the S&P500 using principal component analysis (PCA), and evaluate the performance of the resulting eigenportfolios in terms of Sharpe ratio. The analysis is performed in the jupyter notebook eigenportfolios_pca_spy.ipynb. The S&P500 stock data is contained in the "data" folder.
